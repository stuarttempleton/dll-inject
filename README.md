# Simple DLL injection
This is an extremely simple DLL injector with a template DLL. It's useful for penetration testing, application security testing, game hacking, fringe debugging cases, etc...

* Created with Visual Studio 2019, if that matters to you. 
* Requires admin to run, but uses common API calls. 
* Match the build architecture with the injection target, x86/x64.
* Not reflective.
